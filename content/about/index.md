Hi I am Jan Schutte and I am an Artificial Intelligence student at the 
[University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).
Besides AI I am also interested in software engineering, performance engineering, web-design, writing, electronics, Computer-aided-design and woodworking. I try to [write](posts/) about my projects here on this website.

## Social
I can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-schutte-183145135/) and [Github](https://github.com/DuckerDuck).

## Today
I am currently writing my thesis on unsupervised correspondence learning in videos.

## History
I have worked at [ClickValue](https://clickvalue.nl) as a frontend A/B test developer and at [Adyen](https://adyen.com) in the `NextGen' program as a programmer for in-house projects.
For my study association [**via**](https://svia.nl) I have helped organize programming contests for the Benelux ([BAPC](https://2017.bapc.eu)) and the Amsterdam Scientific-Educational Symposium On Mankind and Information Technology ([Awesome IT](https://2019.awesomeit.nl)). I also help out occasionally with maintaining the **via** website [svia.nl](https://gitlab.com/studieverenigingvia/viaduct).
