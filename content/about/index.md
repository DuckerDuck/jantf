Hi I am Jan and I work as a Data Platform Engineer at Adyen.
I've studied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).
I'm also on the board for [Information Sciences Association for Amsterdam Alumni](https://www.is3a.nl/).
In my spare time I build things from wood, plastic or code.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-schutte-183145135/) and [Github](https://github.com/SchutteJan).
